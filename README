Final Project: Distributed cuda-enabled k-means clustering
Christopher Lupo

to make: type 'make'

to clean: type 'make clean'

to run: ./kmeans <file1> <k>

Where file 1 contains line separated triples of tab seperated floats, for example:

38.8015	-122.771	2.1
37.3649	-117.1248	2.17
37.5468	-118.7905	2.3
.
.
.

and k represents the number of clusters the algorithm will produce.

To run with mpirun on 8 nodes with a hostfile:
time -p mpirun -n 8 --hostfile hostfile -mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0 ./kmeans <file> <k>
